<h1>Problem I</h1>
<h2>I Can Guess the Data Structure!</h2>
</center>

<p>There is a bag-like data structure, supporting two operations:</p>

<pre>1 x</pre>
<p>Throw an element x into the bag.</p>

<pre>2</pre>
<p>Take out an element from the bag.</p>

<p>Given a sequence of operations with return values, you're going to 
guess the data structure. It is a stack (Last-In, First-Out), a queue 
(First-In, First-Out), a priority-queue (Always take out larger elements
 first) or something else that you can hardly imagine!</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line 
containing a single integer n (1&lt;=n&lt;=1000). Each of the next n 
lines is either a type-1 command, or an integer 2 followed by an integer
 x. That means after executing a type-2 command, we get an element x <em>without error</em>.
 The value of x is always a positive integer not larger than 100. The 
input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF). The size of input file does 
not exceed 1MB.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one of the following:</p>

<pre>stack</pre>
<p>It's definitely a stack.</p>

<pre>queue</pre>
<p>It's definitely a queue.</p>

<pre>priority queue</pre>
<p>It's definitely a priority queue.</p>

<pre>impossible</pre>
<p>It can't be a stack, a queue or a priority queue.</p>

<pre>not sure</pre>
<p>It can be more than one of the three data structures mentioned above.</p>
