In the land of ACM ruled a great King who became obsessed with order. The kingdom had 
a rectangular form, and the King divided the territory into a grid of small rectangular 
<span class="textit">counties</span>. Before dying, the King distributed the counties among his sons. 

</p><p>
However, he was unaware that his children had developed a strange rivalry: the first 
heir hated the second heir, but not the rest; the second heir hated the third heir, but 
not the rest, and so on ...Finally, the last heir hated the first heir, but not 
the other heirs. 

</p><p>
As soon as the King died, the strange rivalry among the King's sons sparked off a 
generalized war in the kingdom. Attacks only took place between pairs of adjacent 
counties (adjacent counties are those that share one vertical or horizontal border). 
A county <span class="MATH"><i>X</i></span> attacked an adjacent county <span class="MATH"><i>Y</i></span> whenever the owner of <span class="MATH"><i>X</i></span> hated the owner of 
<span class="MATH"><i>Y</i></span>. The attacked county was always conquered by the attacking brother. By a rule of 
honor all the attacks were carried out simultaneously, and a set of simultaneous 
attacks was called a <span class="textit">battle</span>. After a certain number of battles, the surviving sons 
made a truce and never battled again. 

</p><p>
For example, if the King had three sons, named 
0, 1 and 2, the figure below shows what happens in the first battle for a given initial 
land distribution:

</div>

<p>
You were hired to help an ACM historian determining, given the number of heirs, the 
initial land distribution and the number of battles, what was the land distribution 
after all battles.

<p>
For each test case, your program must print <span class="MATH"><i>R</i></span> lines with <span class="MATH"><i>C</i></span> integers each, separated by 
single spaces in the same format as the input, representing the land distribution after 
all battles.
